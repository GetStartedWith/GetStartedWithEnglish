> ### 5 Habits of Very Successful People

> From VOA Learning English, this is the Health & Lifestyle report.

> Having success and being able to meet one's goals requires knowledge, a sense of direction, hard work and **resources**. Some people might add to that list luck, connections and perhaps a strong belief in yourself.

> We accomplish our goals one step at a time, doing a little each day. So, using your day effectively is important.

> On many websites -- from [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbradberry/2016/10/18/7-things-wildly-successful-people-do-before-730-am/print/) magazine and [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/3033652/work-smart/the-morning-routines-of-the-most-successful-people) to health and physical fitness sites -- productivity experts share advice on how to achieve your career and life goals. Most of the experts agree on one thing: Starting your day **on the right foot** is most important.
